#Environments #

Different environments are provided by the platform in different families:
* [Classic Control Tasks](env_classiccontrol.md): Classic control tasks
* [Atari](env_atari.md): Atari environments
* [Classic Machine Learning](env_classicmachinelearning.md): We also provide some environments that correspond to classical machine learning problems seen as RL environments (classification, one shot learning, structured output prediction, ...)
